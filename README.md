# testing_with_maestro

This project has the main goal of exemplify the use of Maestro Framework in Flutter's E2E testing.

## Context

"testing_with_maestro" is a simple Flutter App for managing a task's list. This app was designed with MVC architecture and uses Cubit for state management. 
This app was quickly developed for me to explore Maestro in E2E testing. The Maestro's test is located under the folder named "maestro" in this repository.
In my opinion (based on this first experience), Maestro is a great tool for testing and gives simplicity and efficience in another level.
All the setup necessary to use this framework was installed locally and you can install in your maching using the guides in References Section and reproduce the results by running this app in your device and executing the command "maestro test maestro/flow.yaml" at the root of this repository.
